	abstract = {Frequent backﬁre can occur in inlet port fuel injection hydrogen internal combustion engines (HICEs) when the equivalence fueleair ratio is larger than 0.56, thus limiting further enhancement of engine power. Thus, to control backﬁre, an inlet port fuel injection HICE test system and a computational ﬂuid dynamics model are established to explore the factors that cause backﬁre under high loads. The temperature and the concentration of the gas mixture near the intake valves are among the essential factors that result in backﬁre. Optimizing the timing and pressure of hydrogen injection reduces the concentration distribution of the intake mixture and the temperature of the high-concentration mixture through the inlet valve, thus allowing control of backﬁre. Controlling backﬁre enables a HICE to work normally at high equivalence fueleair ratio (even beyond 1.0). A HICE with optimized hydrogen injection timing and pressure demonstrates signiﬁcant enhancement of the power output.},

This work has developed a method to control backfire by reducing the valve overlap period while maintaining or improving engine performance. For this goal, a single-cylinder hydrogen-fueled research engine with a mechanical continuous variable valve timing system was developed. This facility provides a wide range of valve overlap periods that can be continuously and independently varied during firing operation. By using this research engine, the behavior of backfire occurrence and engine performance are determined as functions of the valve overlap period for fuel-air equivalence ratios between 0.3 and 1.2.},

	abstract = {For the port injection hydrogen-fueled spark ignition (SI) engine modiﬁed from the Jialing JH600 gasoline engine, the hydrogen injection timing and ignition timing of the hydrogen SI engine are comprehensively optimized on the AVL-FIRE software based on the combination of design of experiment (DOE) and multiple population genetic algorithm (MPGA). Firstly, the effects of hydrogen injection timing and ignition timing on the performance of the hydrogen engine are investigated through the full factors design of experiment scheme, and then the optimum intervals of them are determined respectively. Secondly, the uniform design of experiments scheme is arranged, and the regression functions of indicated power, indicated thermal efﬁciency and emissions of the hydrogen engine under different working conditions are ﬁtted. Then, the comprehensive optimization model is constructed. Finally, the optimum hydrogen injection timing and ignition timing of the hydrogen engine under different working conditions are solved based on MPGA. The results show that, compared with the standard genetic algorithm (SGA), the MPGA has faster convergence speed and higher convergence accuracy. In addition, as the load increases from low to high, the optimum hydrogen injection timing is advanced and the rate of variation increases from 0.6\% to 1.1\%, the optimum ignition timing is delayed and the rate of variation decreases from 29.1\% to 17.8\%.},

	abstract = {In this study, in order to convert a 2.4 L reciprocating gasoline engine into a hydrogen engine an experimental device for supplying hydrogen fuel was installed. Additionally, an injector that is capable of supplying the hydrogen fuel was installed. The basic combustion characteristics, including torque, were investigated by driving the engine with a universal engine control unit. To achieve stable combustion and maximize output, the intake and exhaust valve opening times were changed and the excess air ratio of the mixture was controlled. The changes in the torque, excess air ratio, hydrogen fuel, and intake airﬂow rate, were compared under low engine speed and high load (wide open throttle) operating conditions without throttling. As the intake valve opening time advanced at a certain excess air ratio, the intake air amount and torque increased. When the opening time of the exhaust valve was retarded, the intake airﬂow rate and torque decreased. The torque and thermal efﬁciency decreased when the opening time of the intake and exhaust valve advanced excessively. The change of the mixture condition’s excess air ratio did not inﬂuence the tendency of the torque variation when the exhaust valve opening time and torque increased, and when the mixture became richer and the intake valve opening time was ﬁxed. Under a condition that was more retarded than the 332 CAD condition, the torque decreased by about 2 Nm with the 5 CAD of intake valve opening time retards. The maximum torque of 138.1 Nm was obtained at an optimized intake and the exhaust valve opening time was 327 crank angle degree (CAD) and 161 CAD, respectively, when the excess air ratio was 1.14 and the backﬁre was suppressed. Backﬁre occurred because of the temperature increase in the combustion chamber rather than because of the change in the fuel distribution under the rich mixture condition, where the other combustion control factors were constantly ﬁxed from a three-dimensional (3D) computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) code simulation.},

	abstract = {To research the quality of the hydrogeneair mixture formation and the combustion characteristics of the hydrogen fueled engine under different hydrogen injection timings, nozzle hole positions and nozzle hole diameter, a three-dimensional simulation model for a PFI hydrogen internal combustion engine with the inlet, outlet, valves and cylinder was established using AVL Fire software. In the maximum torque condition, research focused on the variation law of the total hydrogen mass in the cylinder and inlet and the space distribution characteristics and variation law of velocity ﬁeld, concentration ﬁeld and turbulent kinetic energy under different hydrogen injection parameters (injection timings, nozzle hole positions and nozzle hole area) in order to reveal the inﬂuence of these parameters on hydrogeneair mixture formation process. Then the formation quality of hydrogeneair mixture was comprehensively evaluated according to the mixture uniformity coefﬁcient, the remnant hydrogen percentage in the inlet and restraining abnormal combustion (such as preignition and backﬁre). The results showed that the three hydrogen injection parameters have important inﬂuence on the forming quality of hydrogeneair mixture and combustion state. The reasonable choice of the nozzle hole position of hydrogen, nozzle hole diameter and the hydrogen injection time can improve the uniformity of the hydrogeneair mixing in the cylinder of the hydrogen internal combustion engine, and the combustion heat release reaction is more reasonable. At the end of the compression stroke, the equivalence ratio uniform coefﬁcient increased at ﬁrst and then decreased with the beginning of the hydrogen injection. When hydrogen injection starting point was with 410e430 CA, equivalence ratio uniform coefﬁcient was larger, and ignition delay period was shorter so that the combustion performance index was also good. And remnant hydrogen percentage in the inlet was less, high concentration of mixed gas in the vicinity of the inlet valve also gathered less, thus suppressing the preignition and backﬁre. With the increase of the distance between the nozzle and the inlet valve, the selection of the hydrogen injection period is narrowed, and the optimum hydrogen injection time was also ahead of time. The results also showed that it was favorable for the formation of uniform mixing gas when the nozzle hole diameter was 4 mm.},

This simultaneous achievement would be possible with the use of low temperature combustion, which supercharges an ultra-lean mixture, because NOx from a hydrogen engine is thermally produced. However, increasing the energy input for higher output produces backﬁre, which is a signiﬁcant problem for hydrogen-fueled engines with external mixture, and why the simultaneous achievement of high output and low-exhaust is not easily accomplished. This research investigated the potential of simultaneously achieving high output, similar to the output of a gasoline engine, without backﬁre, by using a complex valve timing variation and lean boosting. The study achieved almost zero NOx emission and high efﬁciency in a single cylinder engine built for research purposes with a valve timing variation system.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on optimizing the hydrogen TMI (timed manifold injection) system through valve lift law and hydrogen injection parameters (pressure, injection inclination and timing) in order to prevent backﬁre phenomena and improve the volumetric efﬁciency and mixture formation quality of a dual fuel diesel engine operating at high load and high hydrogen energy share. This was achieved through a numerical simulation using CFD code ANSYS Fluent, developed for a single cylinder hydrogen-diesel dual fuel engine, at constant engine speed of 1500 rpm, 90\% of load and 42.5\% hydrogen energy share. The developed tool was validated using experimental data. As a results, the operating conditions of maximum valve lift ¼ 10.60 mm and inlet valve closing ¼ 30  CA ABDC (MVL10 IVC30) prevent the engine from backﬁre and pre-ignition, and ensure a high volumetric efﬁciency. Moreover, a hydrogen start of injection of 60  CA ATDC (HSOI60) is appropriate to provide a pre-cooling effect and thus, reduce the pre-ignition sources and helps to quench any hot residual combustion products. While, the hydrogen injection pressure of 2.7 bar and an inclination of 60 , stimulate a better quality of hydrogen-air mixture. Afterwards, a comparison between combustion characteristics of the optimized hydrogen-diesel dual fuel mode and the baseline (diesel mode) was conducted. The result was, under dual fuel mode there is an increase in combustion characteristics and NOx emissions as well as a decrease in CO2 emissions. For further improvement of dual fuel mode, retarding diesel start of injection (DSOI) strategy was used.},
